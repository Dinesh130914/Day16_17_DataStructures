Meenakshi temple is one of the most famous temples of South India. It is built in the Dravidian style. The temple houses the wife of Lord Shiva, Meenakshi (fish-eyed). The temple is a double shrine, one dedicated to Meenakshi and the other to her consort, built inside a larger shrine.

The main temple is enclosed in a wall about 850 feet by 725 feet and at the centre of each wall is a Gopuram (pyramidical structure built over the gare.vay) which is a distinctive feature of Dravidian temple architecture.
